# AI-Powered Customer Support Agent 🚀🤖

An advanced **LangGraph-powered AI Customer Support Agent** designed to enhance customer interactions, improve response accuracy, and streamline support efficiency using **LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI**.

---

## 🔍 How It Works
Built using **LangGraph** and **LangChain**, this AI-driven support agent leverages **LLMs** to:
- ✅ **Categorize inquiries** – Classifies issues into **Technical, Billing, or General** 📂
- ✅ **Analyze sentiment** – Detects user emotions in real time 😊😡
- ✅ **Generate intelligent responses** – Provides context-aware, dynamic replies ✍️
- ✅ **Automate decision-making** – Streamlines support operations 🔄

- 🔹 **More accurate, context-aware responses** 🎯
- 🔹 **Scalable and adaptive customer interactions** 🔄
- 🔹 **Smarter automation for personalized support** 🤖
